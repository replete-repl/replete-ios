# Build Curl for iOS

1. Clone `https://github.com/jasonacox/Build-OpenSSL-cURL`
1. Go into that project and run `./build.sh`
1. Copy the resulting `curl`, `openssl` and `nghttp2` directories into the `Replete` directory.
1. The Xcode project is already set up to look in these directories for headers and static libs.

# Running

1. Clone [planck](https://github.com/mfikes/planck) into a sibling directory and build it.
1. In the `ClojureScript/replete` directory, do `script/build`
1. Do a `pod install` in the top level.
1. `open Replete.xcworkspace` with Xcode and run the app on a device or in the simulator.
